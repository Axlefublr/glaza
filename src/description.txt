`glaza` is a program for tracking the shows you watch.

All of the information is kept in three files in your data_directory/glaza, which is:
linux — $XDG_DATA_HOME/glaza
macos — $HOME/Library/Application Support/glaza
windows — %APPDATA%/glaza

`current.yml` contains the information about shows you're currently in the process of watching.
Every show has multiple properties you can set.
1. Show title
2. The episode number of the latest episode you finished watching
3. The episode number of the latest episode you *downloaded*
4. The link to where you watch (stream) the show
5. The link to where you *download* the show

Both the episode and link are separated for streaming / downloading this way, so that you can track both of those separately. This is mostly useful with the `watch` and `save` subcommands, that let you open the next episode to either watch, or download.

`watched.txt` contains a list of all the shows you finished watching, or dropped. New shows appear in this list thanks to `finish` and `drop` subcommands.

`watch-later.txt` contains a list of shows you plan to watch. You can use `add` to add new shows, and `discard` to remove shows from that list.

A lot of subcommands take `show` as an argument.
How it's interpreted is slightly different per subcommand, to make for a better user experience.

`watch`, `save`, `plink`, `pdlink`, `remove`, `episode`, `save`, `link`, `discard` —
all assume that the show already exists. So the way it's interpreted:
1. If `--index`/`-i` flag is present, it is used, ignoring the value specified for `show`.
2. If the show title directly matches to an existing one, it is used
3. Otherwise, the *first* one that matches is used. Keep in mind that the order of shows is the same as
   the output of `shows` or `wl`, depending on what the subcommand is dealing with.
